    <h1>Ashok Nagar Metro Station</h1>
    <br>
    <hr color="Brown">
    <p>Upon completion, Ashok Nagar Metro Rail station will be the highest elevated station in the entire Chennai Metro Rail system. Initially planned to have a ground floor, a concourse floor and a platform floor, four additional floors have been planned to the original plan to make it a six-storey structure, chiefly to generate revenue by letting out the floors to offices and commercial establishments. After completion, the station will have a height of more than 40 metres, which will be higher than the Alandur metro rail elevated station where the two corridors of Phase I of the Chennai Metro Rail (viz. Washermenpet-Airport and Central-St Thomas Mount lines) converge.</p>
